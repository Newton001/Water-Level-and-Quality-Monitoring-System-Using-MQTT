# Water-Level-and-Quality-Monitoring-System-Using-MQTT
Water is an important resource for the livelihood of human beings. The quality of water used affects the health of the consumers. Storage vessels tend to develop microbes that lower the water quality. Microbes cause infectious diseases such as flu and measles. There is also strong evidence that microbes may contribute to many nonâ€“infectious chronic diseases such as cancer and coronary heart disease. The level of water in an enclosed tank is often unknown leading to a lack of water when there is no supply of water into the tank or water overflow due to lack of observation of the level of water in the tank. This project seeks to address this by the use of an ultrasonic sensor, analog pH sensor, and turbidity sensor to obtain the data on the state of water in the tank. The level of water and water condition data is sent to a mobile application for observation, and initiation of a required response for instance automation of water pumping into the tank as well as switching off of the pumping action. The proposed project will utilize Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) IoT technology.
